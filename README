Mote3D is an open-source software toolbox for the generation of random particulate
microstructure models with periodic boundaries. Mote3D can be used to generate models 
that represent the microstructure of various inhomogeneous engineering materials such 
as particle-reinforced composites, ceramics, powders or open-cell foams. These models
can be employed, for example, to analyse the relation between microstructure and
mechanical, electrical or thermal properties by numerical simulations.

The Mote3D toolbox works by randomly positioning spherical particles with
user-defined minimum inter-particle distance in a cubical computational domain.
The generated microstructure models can be exported in different formats, either
as lists of particle centre coordinates and radii or as input scripts for generating
solid geometric models or regular hexahedral meshes (‘voxel meshes’) in the commercial
finite-element software Abaqus(TM) or similar preprocessors.
